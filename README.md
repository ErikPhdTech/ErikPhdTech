- 👋 Hi, I’m @ErikPhdTech
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and use it to develop my own applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift and anything about NFTs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. However, later I would like to collab on Swift projects and NFT minting.
- 📫 How to reach me by sending me a mesage via Github.
